After multiple years of putting off creating my own blog, I have succumbed and created my static blog using Jekyll and hosted using GitHub pages.

At this point I am tired of using Wordpress or Medium or any other kind of fancy blogging sites which take forever to load serving mostly static content.

I guess it's time to get a domain name too.
