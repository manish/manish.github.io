I am a Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience. 

During the day, I love working on some of the most difficult and challenging problems I can put my hands on. I am motivated by the impact of my work on customers and stakeholders.

Over time I have developed interest in quite a lot of after-work activities.

* During weekends I spend my time working out 🏋️ and boxing 🥊.

* During the weekend, I spend my time [hiking][manishsinha-strava] 🥾 , running 👟  and cycling 🚴‍♂️

* When the weather does not play nice, I like learning to cook 🧑🏽‍🍳  something new, reading books 📚 and binging a new TV show 📺
